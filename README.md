# CloudBot
It's a bot that I made in 2 days, several parts are still WIP.
# How to use
Firstly, you need to install two packages, `discord.py` and `python-dotenv`, from PyPI.
Secondly, go to `.env` file and replace `{YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}` with your bot TOKEN.
Lastly, run `main.py`.
Enjoy playing this useless bot!

Reminder: The coin is not seperated by server, it's global.
